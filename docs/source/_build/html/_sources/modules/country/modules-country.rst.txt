Country Module
##############

The country module defines the concepts of country and subdivision and
comes preloaded with the ISO 3166 list of countries and subdivisions
thanks to the pycountry module.


Country
*******

A country is defined by the full name of the country, a code (the ISO
country code made of two chars) and the list of subdivisions.


Subdivision
***********

A subdivision is defined by a name, a code and a type (e.g, Capital
City, Province, Emirate, etc)


Zip
***

A zip links a zip code of a country to a city.

Scripts
*******

There are two scripts:

* `trytond_import_countries` to create and update countries and
  subdivisions from the ISO database.

* `trytond_import_zip` to create zips by country from the geonames database.
