Account Stock Landed Cost Module
################################

The ``account_stock_landed_cost`` module allows to allocate landed cost on
*Supplier Shipments* after their reception.

A new field is added to *Product*:

- *Landed Cost*: Only available for service, it allows such invoiced product to
  be used as a landed cost.

A new document *Landed Cost* defines how posted supplier invoice lines are
allocated to many shipments.

The allocation methods are:

    - *By Value*: The cost will be allocated according to the value of each
      line. (The value is: *Quantity* * *Unit *Price*)

Once posted, the *Landed Cost* updates the unit price of each incoming moves of
the shipments using the cost of all the invoice lines according to the
allocation method.

To update the cost price, the *Update Cost Price* wizard must be run on the
affected products.
