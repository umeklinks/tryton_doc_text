Authentication SMS Module
#########################

The `SMS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service>`_ authentication
module allows to authenticate users via SMS.  There are two authentication
methods `sms` and `password_sms` which can be used in the `authentications`
list of the `session` section in the configuration.

The `sms` method just send a code via SMS to the user. Then the user needs to
transcribe the code into the login dialog.

The `password_sms` method send a code only after the user entered a valid
password. This provides a `two-factor authentication
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication>`_ method.

Both methods require that the user has a *Mobile* phone number defined
otherwise he can not be authenticated with those methods.
