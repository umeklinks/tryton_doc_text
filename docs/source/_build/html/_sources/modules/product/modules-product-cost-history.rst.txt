Product Cost History Module
###########################

The Product Cost History Module adds a *Cost History* relate on the product
form showing the cost price evolution of the product. The history is based on
the cost price stored on the incoming stock moves for goods and assets and
based on the history table for service.
When a historic cost price is needed the value is taken from this history for
goods and assets.
