Template and Product.

The Product Template model contains the following fields:

  the cost price should be updated. *Fixed* means that the cost price
  stay unchanged. *Average* means that the cost price is the average
  cost of all the items that are in stock. It's default value can be defined
  on product configuration.

The Product model extends the Product Template with two fields: Code (aka SKU_)
and Description. If a sequence is set on product configuration the code will be
read-only and will be filled in using the sequence. It's also possible to
define a list of identifiers on product. An identifier is composed by a type
and a code. The following types are available:

    * International Article Number (EAN)

    * International Standard Identifier for Libraries (ISIL)
